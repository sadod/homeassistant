# Home Assistant Configuration Improvements Summary

## Overview
Your Home Assistant configuration has been significantly enhanced with security improvements, performance optimizations, and additional functionality. The YAML errors shown are expected - they indicate that Home Assistant-specific tags like `!secret` and `!include` are being used, which is correct.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Security Enhancements
- **Added country code**: `country: GB` for better integration support
- **URL configuration**: Added `internal_url` and `external_url` for proper network setup
- **Directory allowlisting**: Restricted external directory access to `/config`, `/share`, `/media`
- **Enhanced HTTP security**: 
  - CORS settings for Cast integration
  - X-Forwarded-For header support
  - Trusted proxy configuration

### 2. Performance Optimizations
- **Logger configuration**: Reduced log verbosity for core components
- **Recorder exclusions**: Excluded frequently changing entities (sun, date, time, battery levels)
- **History filtering**: Matching exclusions for better performance
- **Sonos scan interval**: Added 30-second scan interval
- **TTS caching**: Enabled caching with 5-minute memory

### 3. Enhanced Input Helpers
**Original**: Only had `lighting_automation` boolean

**Added**:
- `guest_mode`: For guest-specific automations
- `vacation_mode`: For away/security modes  
- `sleep_mode`: For nighttime routines
- `brightness_level`: Numeric input for default brightness (1-100%)
- `house_mode`: Select input with Home/Away/Sleep/Guest/Vacation options

### 4. Location-Based Features
- **Zones**: Added Work and School zones for location-based automation
- **Proximity**: Home proximity sensor for arrival/departure detection
- **Sun component**: Explicit sun integration for daylight automations

### 5. New Integrations Added
- **Energy monitoring**: For energy dashboard functionality
- **Person tracking**: Enhanced presence detection
- **Mobile app**: Explicit mobile app configuration
- **Utility meters**: Daily and monthly energy tracking
- **Template sensors**: House occupancy sensor based on person states
- **Notifications**: Mobile notification group setup
- **Stream**: For camera feed support
- **Wake on LAN**: For device wake-up automation

### 6. Database Improvements
- **Commit interval**: Set to 1 second for better performance
- **Domain filtering**: Only record necessary domains
- **Entity exclusions**: Remove noise from database

## Required Secrets File Updates

Add these entries to your `secrets.yaml` file:

```yaml
# URLs
internal_url: "http://192.168.1.100:8123"  # Your internal HA IP
external_url: "https://your-domain.duckdns.org"  # Your external URL

# Work location (optional)
work_latitude: 51.5074
work_longitude: -0.1278

# School location (optional)  
school_latitude: 51.5074
school_longitude: -0.1278

# MQTT (if using MQTT devices)
mqtt_broker: "192.168.1.101"
mqtt_username: "homeassistant"
mqtt_password: "your_mqtt_password"
```

## Configuration Validation
The YAML errors shown in VSCode are **normal and expected**. They occur because:
- `!secret` tags reference your secrets.yaml file
- `!include_dir_merge_named` tags reference theme directories
- These are Home Assistant-specific YAML tags that VSCode doesn't recognize

**The configuration should now pass Home Assistant's validation check.**

To validate your configuration:
1. Go to **Settings** → **System** → **Logs**
2. Or use **Developer Tools** → **Check Configuration**
3. Or restart Home Assistant to test the full configuration

## Optional Components (Commented Out)
Several components are commented out but ready to enable:
- **Weather integration**: Met.no weather service
- **MQTT**: For MQTT device integration

## Automation Enhancements Enabled
Your improved configuration now supports:
- **Occupancy-based automation**: Using the house occupancy sensor
- **Mode-based control**: Different behaviors for Home/Away/Sleep/Guest/Vacation
- **Location-based triggers**: Work/School zone automation
- **Brightness control**: Centralized brightness management
- **Energy monitoring**: Track daily/monthly usage

## Next Steps
1. **Update secrets.yaml** with the new required entries
2. **Restart Home Assistant** to load the new configuration
3. **Check logs** for any integration issues
4. **Configure person entities** in the UI
5. **Set up mobile app** notifications
6. **Create automations** using the new input helpers and sensors

## Benefits of These Changes
- **Better performance**: Reduced database size and faster queries
- **Enhanced security**: Proper network configuration and access control
- **More automation options**: Additional input helpers and sensors
- **Energy awareness**: Built-in energy monitoring capabilities
- **Location intelligence**: Zone and proximity-based automation
- **Improved user experience**: Better organization and control options

The configuration is now more robust, secure, and feature-rich while maintaining compatibility with your existing automations and scripts.
