   - Enhanced security with country code, directory allowlisting, HTTP security
   - Optimized performance with database exclusions and logger configuration
   - Added comprehensive input helpers (boolean, number, select)
   - Created template sensor for house occupancy detection
   - Fixed validation issues by commenting out components requiring additional setup

2. **Windows Development Environment Setup**
   - Installed Git v2.51.0, Node.js v22.19.0, Python v3.13.0
   - Set up Windows Terminal, PowerShell 7, Docker Desktop, Postman
   - Configured PowerShell execution policy for script support
   - Verified all installations with version checks
   - Created comprehensive documentation

3. **Memory Bank System Implementation**
   - Established complete Memory Bank structure
   - Documented project brief, product context, system patterns, technical context
   - Created foundation for future session continuity

### Current Session Status
- **Session Type**: Task completion and documentation
- **Primary Achievement**: Dual-purpose project completion (HA config + dev environment)
- **Documentation State**: Comprehensive guides created for both components
- **Validation Status**: Home Assistant configuration passes validation checks
- **Tool Status**: All development tools installed and verified working

## Recent Changes

### Home Assistant Configuration Changes
```yaml
# Major additions/improvements:
- Added country: GB for better integration support
- Implemented security-first HTTP configuration
- Added comprehensive input helper suite
- Created house occupancy template sensor
- Optimized recorder and history for performance
- Commented out optional components requiring additional setup

# Validation fixes applied:
- Removed undefined secret references (internal_url, external_url)
- Commented out zones requiring coordinate secrets
- Commented out utility meters requiring energy sensors
- Commented out proximity requiring person entities
- Commented out notifications requiring mobile app setup
```

### Development Environment Changes
```powershell
# Tools installed via winget:
winget install --id Git.Git
winget install --id OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS
winget install --id Microsoft.WindowsTerminal
winget install --id Microsoft.PowerShell
winget install --id Python.Python.3.12  # Got v3.13.0
winget install --id Docker.DockerDesktop
winget install --id Postman.Postman

# Configuration changes:
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
$env:PATH refresh for new tool recognition
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions for User
1. **Configure Git Identity**
   ```powershell
   git config --global user.name "Your Full Name"
   git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
   ```

2. **Install VS Code Extensions**
   - GitLens, Prettier, ESLint, Python, Docker extensions

3. **Set Up SSH Keys for Git**
   ```powershell
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your.email@example.com"
   ```

4. **Install Global npm Packages**
   ```powershell
   npm install -g typescript nodemon eslint prettier
   ```

### Home Assistant Next Steps
1. **Update secrets.yaml** with any additional secrets needed
2. **Uncomment optional components** as needed (zones, utility meters, etc.)
3. **Create automations** using the new input helpers
4. **Test configuration** after any changes

### Development Environment Next Steps
1. **Restart computer** to ensure Docker Desktop initializes properly
2. **Configure Windows Terminal** with preferred themes and settings
3. **Set up project directories** (C:\Dev\Projects\, etc.)
4. **Install additional tools** as needed for specific projects

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Home Assistant Design Decisions
- **Commented vs Removed**: Chose to comment out optional components rather than remove them entirely
- **Security First**: Prioritized security configurations over convenience
- **Performance Focus**: Excluded frequently changing entities from database
- **Modular Structure**: Maintained separation of concerns with file includes

### Development Environment Design Decisions
- **winget over Chocolatey**: Native Windows package manager for better integration
- **LTS Versions**: Stability over cutting-edge features
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Self-service approach for user independence
- **PowerShell 7**: Modern shell over legacy Windows PowerShell

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Configuration Patterns
- **Validation-First**: Ensure configuration passes checks before adding complexity
- **Documentation-Driven**: Every change documented with rationale
- **Incremental Improvement**: Build complexity gradually
- **Error Recovery**: Provide clear troubleshooting steps

### Development Patterns
- **Tool Verification**: Always verify installations with version checks
- **Environment Refresh**: Handle PATH and environment variable updates
- **Comprehensive Setup**: Install complete toolchain rather than minimal setup
- **Future-Proofing**: Document next steps and expansion possibilities

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Home Assistant Insights
- **Validation Sensitivity**: Home Assistant validation is strict about undefined references
- **Optional Components**: Better to comment out than remove - shows possibilities
- **Performance Impact**: Database exclusions have significant performance benefits
- **Security Importance**: Modern HA requires proper security configuration

### Development Environment Insights
- **winget Reliability**: Windows Package Manager is mature and reliable
- **PowerShell Evolution**: PowerShell 7 is significantly better than Windows PowerShell
- **Tool Integration**: Modern development tools integrate well when properly configured
- **Documentation Value**: Comprehensive documentation prevents future confusion

### Process Insights
- **Memory Bank Value**: Structured documentation enables session continuity
- **Dual-Purpose Projects**: Can successfully handle multiple related objectives
- **Validation Importance**: Always verify installations and configurations
- **User Empowerment**: Provide tools and knowledge for user independence
